(Wish on a star.)

What can we do in isolation?
What can we do the situation?
世界は果て　We're wingless birds

What can we do in isolation?
What can we do the situation?
生きる為に　We commit a crime

(Bring peace to the world.)

無意味なconversation

It's not a big deal. yeah-you're right.
We'll just go to the end,
and you need to think nothing, nothing, nothing.

きらきら星に　願いを　君より後に　逝こう
きらきら星に　願いを　君の代わりに　泣こう
